# Utility for fitting photos to the desired format of stickers in Telegram

Fit photos proportionally to `512x512` size and convert format of photos into `png`.
So you can send them to the Sticker bot in Telegram.

## How to use:
* Use command in terminal: `pip install pillow`
* Paste all photos that you need to convert in directory `ImagesToConvert`
* Run script and watch the result in directory `ConvertedImages`


I made it for myself, because it was taking a lot of time to convert each image to needed format :-)
